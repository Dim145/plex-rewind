# Plex Rewind

A Plex Rewind application in the spirit of [Spotify Wrapped](https://www.spotify.com/us/wrapped).

Present user statistics and habits in a beautiful and organized manner - as a web application application powered by [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) and [Tailwind.css](https://tailwindcss.com), using data from [Tautulli](https://tautulli.com) and [Overseerr](https://overseerr.dev/). You can also disable the Rewind functionality and just use it as a sharable Dashboard for your Plex users or vice versa.

## Getting started

This project is ongoing active development and is not considered stable. If you still wish to try it out, you can follow the instructions below.

1. Get the latest release from the [releases page](https://github.com/RaunoT/plex-rewind/releases) or clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/RaunoT/plex-rewind.git --branch main
```

2. Fill out the variables in the `.env` file.

3. You can now run `docker compose build` to build the application and then `docker compose up -d` to start it. To update, download the latest release, or if you cloned the repo, run `git pull` and repeat the docker compose commands.

4. The application should now be running on [http://localhost:8383](http://localhost:8383).

5. (optional) You can expose the app to the internet using a reverse proxy of your choice. Or you can skip all of the above, fork this repository instead, and deploy it to [Vercel](https://vercel.com). You can set the env variables under "Settings" > "Environment Variables" for your project.

## Variables reference

### Required variables

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_TAUTULLI_URL` is the URL where your Tautulli instance is located. Please use a private network address instead of localhost to allow Docker to access it. Example: `NEXT_PUBLIC_TAUTULLI_URL=http://192.168.1.2:8181`.
- `TAUTULLI_API_KEY` can be found under Tautulli settings > Web Interface > API > API Key.
- `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` is used for encrypting the NextAuth.js JWT. It can be generated by running `openssl rand -base64 32` in your terminal, or by using an online generator like [the one by Vercel](https://generate-secret.vercel.app/32).
- `PLEX_HOSTNAME` and `PLEX_PORT` are needed to get your server ID via the Plex API, which allows setting deeplinks to open your media items.
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` and `NEXTAUTH_URL` should be set to the URL where you're hosting the application.
- `TMDB_API_KEY` is used for fetching ratings.

> **_IMPORTANT:_** You must also add your Tautulli URL to `next.config.js` under `images.remotePatterns` to allow fetching posters.

### Optional variables

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_OVERSEERR_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_OVERSEERR_API_KEY` are used to fetch requests data from Overseerr and the "Request" button functionality.
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_ID` can be used to set up Google Analytics.
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_EXCLUDED_LIBRARIES` is used for excluding libraries from Rewind and Dashboard. Accepted values are library names, separated by a comma. For example: `NEXT_PUBLIC_EXCLUDED_LIBRARIES=Movies,Music`.
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_IS_REWIND_DISABLED` allows disabling Rewind.
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_IS_DASHBOARD_DISABLED` allows disabling Dashboard.
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_STATISTICS_START_DATE` expects `YYYY-MM-DD` format and will default to `2018-01-01`. It is used for the "all time" option in Dashboard.
